##Abstract

Judging performance of various network analysis schemes to detect covert populations
is hard.  One way to gain confidence about the performance is to take real empirical
data, synthesize the covert population in various ways, insert them into data, and then run detection
scheme against augmented dataset.

##Introduction

##Data Set

##Methods

The Montreal Data comprises (1) user ids logging into (2) location ids at (3) start
times until logging out at (4) stop times.

A synthetic population must also produce this behavior.  Covert groups, by
definition, attempt to conceal their identity.  For the purposes of this
validation approach, we will assume that the group members "act like" general
population. That is, the number of locations they visit, the rate that they use
the system, their duration of usage, *etc* - these should similar to the rest of
the population. Of course, particular covert groups will have varying degrees of
success, and actual groups may well produce a signal within the data which does
not require network-based approaches to detect.
